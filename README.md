# Neo4j Visualization Project

This project is a web-based tool that allows users to visualize and interact with graph data stored in a Neo4j database. The application is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Neovis.js, and it provides features for filtering nodes and relationships, searching for specific nodes, and stabilizing the graph's layout.

## Features

- **Interactive Graph Visualization**: Displays nodes and relationships from a Neo4j database in an interactive, visual format.
- **Node and Relationship Filtering**: Easily filter the visualization to show specific node labels (e.g., Person, Movie, User) and relationship types (e.g., ACTED_IN, DIRECTED, RATED).
- **Search Functionality**: Search for nodes by name or title and visualize their connections.
- **Graph Stabilization**: Stop the movement of nodes in the graph to stabilize the layout.
- **Responsive Design**: The interface is designed to be responsive, working seamlessly across devices of different sizes.
- **Reset Functionality**: Quickly reset the graph to its initial state after applying filters or performing a search.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For structuring the application.
- **CSS3**: For styling the application and ensuring it is responsive.
- **JavaScript (ES6)**: For dynamic interaction and controlling the visualization.
- **Neovis.js**: Integrates Neo4j with Vis.js to visualize graph data directly from the database.
